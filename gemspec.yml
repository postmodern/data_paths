description: 
  DataPaths is a library to manage the paths of directories containing
  static-content across multiple libraries. For example, DataPaths can
  manage the `data/` directories of multiple RubyGems, in much the same way
  RubyGems manages the paths of `lib/` directories using `$LOAD_PATH`.
